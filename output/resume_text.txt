AI  Dev Standup Buddy — LLM-powered developer productivity agent                                    Jul 2025                  
 
• 
Tools/Technologies used: Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, LangChain, GitPython, Prompt Engineering 
 
• 
Built an AI-powered Dev Standup Agent that auto-generates daily developer updates (Yesterday / Today / Blockers) by 
analyzing Git commit messages and task activity, eliminating manual reporting. 
 
• 
Used LangChain + OpenAI API to generate natural-language standup summaries from structured/unstructured developer 
input, simulating real-world team workflows. 
 
• 
Demonstrated use of agent-style workflows, LLM reasoning over developer data, and Git history parsing (via GitPython) for 
actionable insights.

• 
Developed an AI-powered tool to evaluate how well a resume matches a job description using skill-based and semantic 
similarity scoring 
• 
Implemented NLP-based skill extraction using spaCy's tokenization, noun chunking, and custom patterns from resume & JD 
PDFs 
• 
Leveraged Sentence-BERT embeddings to compute cosine-similarity scores, then applied a weighted match (70% must-have, 
30% optional) for ATS-style filtering 
• 
Designed a Streamlit interface supporting single-resume analysis and multi-resume ranking, with PDF upload, interactive 
metrics, and sortable result tables 
• 
Generated detailed matching reports with matched/missing skills, scores, and personalized recommendations
